<span class="blue">How To Play</span><br><br>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Register at the above portal and get your unique login.
<li>Download the base application we provide you with (consisting of both source code and an unstable executable).
<li>Play, tinker with it.
<li>Read and Develop the code on your own.
<li>Download others\' code and build on it.
<li>Submit(host) it in your account.
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The Base Code will be available in two languages(C/Java). You are free to download both of the source codes, develop and submit them back to us. You will be evaluated individually for each of your submissions and marks will be given accordingly. At the end of the event, separate winners will be announced for each of the languages.
</p>
<p>
The event spans Three Phases.
<br>
<span class="white">Phase I</span>	December 15th to December 31st <br>
<span class="white">Phase II</span>	January 1st to January 10th <br>
<span class="white">Phase III</span>	January 11th to January 20th <br>
</p>
<p>
The Base Application will be released incrementally at the start of every phase.
(Even if you were not able to contribute in the first phase, you are still able to build on the upgraded code released at the start of the second phase.)
</p>
<p>
Once you download someone\'s code, that someone will receive an alert saying that his code was downloaded by you. If you fail to give him the due credit(by mentioning his contribution in your documentation), he has every right to complain. Genuine complaints may result in reduction of points to disqualification and judges decision will be final.
</p>
<p>
Bogus complaints will be treated similarly.
</p>
<p>
If someone uses your code, 20% of the points he gets for his submission will be awarded to you. He will not receive any reduction.
</p>
<p>
<span class="blue">Sample Scenario:</span><br><br>

Person A gets x points.<br>
Person B uses A and gets y points.<br>
---Person A will get 20% y (inaddition to his x)<br>
Person C uses B and gets z points.<br>
---Person B will get 20% z (inaddition to his y)<br>
<br><br>
Please note that A will NOT get any increment even though C indirectly uses A.
